## Sentiment Analysis of Jogja Smart Service (JSS) User Reviews
This project analyzes user sentiment toward the Jogja Smart Service (JSS) application, a digital public service platform developed by the Yogyakarta City Government, using Google Play Store reviews. A Random Forest classification model was applied to categorize reviews into positive, neutral, and negative sentiments, achieving an accuracy of 80%. Analysis of reviews from 2021–2023 revealed that negative sentiment initially dominated, while evaluation on newer data from 2023–2024 showed a significant increase in positive sentiment, indicating improved user satisfaction. The results provide actionable insights to support service quality evaluation and continuous improvement of digital public services.

## Project Overview
This project analyzes user sentiment toward the Jogja Smart Service (JSS) application, a digital public service platform developed by the Yogyakarta City Government. The analysis uses Google Play Store reviews to evaluate user satisfaction and identify improvement opportunities through sentiment classification.

## Objectives
- Analyze public sentiment toward the JSS application  
- Classify user reviews into positive, neutral, and negative sentiments  
- Identify sentiment trends across different time periods  
- Generate insights to support digital public service improvement  

## Dataset
